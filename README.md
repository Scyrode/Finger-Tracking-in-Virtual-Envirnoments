# Finger-Tracking-in-Virtual-Envirnoments

This is my thesis project titled "Camera Independent 6-DOF Hand and Finger Tracking in Virtual Environments". 
This finger tracking solution was created to explore the potential of using IR sensors for the purposes of finger tracking.
The showcased demo is a small game aimed at individuals with limited finger and hand mobility. The game incentives the user 
to create different gestures by awarding them with a score for each completed hand gesture.
